<p align="center">Well, I'll tell you something that should be of vital interest to you.…That you, Sir, are a NITWIT! I don't need a sword. Because I'm the Doctor ... and this is my spoon. Fantastic! Oh, my giddy aunt! Goodbye... Fancypants! I might've been saying something important. I was saying something important! t's called the TARDIS, this thing. T-A-R-D-I-S. That's Time And Relative Dimension In Space. That’s okay. Culture shock. Happens to the best of us. Powerful! Crush the lesser races! Conquer the galaxy! UNIMAGINABLE POWER! UNLIMITED RICE PUDDING! Et cetera! Et cetera!

Come on! Change, my dear. And it seems not a moment too soon. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. What do you think it is, a space helmet for a cow? Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime. Dreams are important…never underestimate them. What?! Come out. And don't touch anything! Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. Excellent. Blow up that vehicle. That's a relief. I hate babysitters. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice.

The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. The universe hangs by such a delicate thread of coincidences that it would be useless to meddle with it, unless like me you're a Time Lord. I don't like it. An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. The Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment - we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space/time travel. Not allowed? Not allowed? Me, I’m allowed everywhere.

Oh, marvellous. You're going to kill me. What a finely tuned response to the situation. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man! Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. Let's go in! Hello-o-o-o. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! Well, I'll tell you something that should be of vital interest to you.…That you, Sir, are a NITWIT! An old friend of mine. Well, enemy. The stuff of nightmares reduced to an exhibit. I'm getting old.</p>
